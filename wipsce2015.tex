\section{Introduction}
Computational thinking is super awsome...
HCI is a well established area of significance to computer science, but also it is a multi-disciplinary discipline which, we argue, has aspects of relevance to computational thinking.Interactivity and design has been somewhat neglected during the growth of computational thinking and there is also a gap in the teaching of computing (cite Kent people). Some solution methodologies are detailed, targeted at particular aspects of HCI, presented in the form of sessions accessible to children of ages ??? not sure yet.



 
\section{Suggested sessions}
We now give methodologies, in the form of activity-based learning sessions, to teach elements crucial to HCI to secondary school students. These are ideas are influence by \cite{normanDesign}, \cite{rogers2011interaction} and \cite{shneiderman1986designing}.
\subsection{First session}
The first session we describe is intended to cover negative transfer as well as the principle of affordance, and we break down the explanation not by the flow of the session, but by the intended learning outcome, this is intended to facilitate also the explanation of the effects making the presentation accessible outside the HCI community. The session was devised with the use of a "doll house" specifically designed in a self-contradictory manner. The students are given clues to navigate around the house and their goal is to find a pebble. To find the hidden pebble, the students must follow instructions and activities specified in the cards. This follows similar patterns as a popular game show, and the reason is to help the students view this as a fun activity rather than a typical learning session (via traditional classroom environments).

\subsubsection*{Principle of affordance}
Affordances are the prduct of agents and their enviromnet \cite{gibson1977theory}, gien any agent-environment combination a affordance may or may not exist. If one does the agent needs to be aware of it, however for most HCI researchers when affordance is mentioned it is typically assumed that the agent is aware of it,  calls this a perceived affordance \cite{norman1999affordance}.

The very first instruction given to students is to simply enter the house, the entrance consists of a front door, porch, both doors have a door knob, the first door must be pushed whereas the second door needs to be pulled. Students are likely to try to turn the knob the first time and push the second. This is a good point to explain a bit about how past experiences can affect learning of new tasks. In addition most students are likely to attempt to turn the knob, which makes it an excellent point to teach students about the principle of affordance. 


\subsubsection*{Explaining transfer effects applied to desgin methods in HCI}
In a nutshell negative transfer\cite{Lunchin, Pan2010, Woltz} is a term behavioural psychologist used to describe how new task learning can be negatively affected by knowledge of similar or related tasks.
This has consequences to design of interactive designs \cite{waern1993varieties} For example,\cite{Besnard2005105} uses a simulated experiment (based on real industrial work environments) to support a hypothesis of how interface changes are less likely to cause accidents when it limits changes to former interaction patterns.

Amongst the instructions, pupils are asked to fill up a watering can in the kitchen, water the plants, return to the house and clean the same watering can in the downstairs guest bathroom. The first tap used must be turned clockwise in order to let out water, conversely the second tap must be turned anti-clockwise for the same goal to be achieved. This is the second intentional opportunity during the activity, in which teachers can explain transfer effects and start a discussion bout its importance to design.

\subsection{Second Session}
The second session is based on a similar activity as published in {CS website}
Cooking ingredients to transform into symbols and see if other groups can use them.

\subsubsection*{Design for recognition}
 
As the above section demonstrate, learning how to achieve certain tasks will have consequences to learning new tasks. As humans we are constantly learning new skills and it is thus essential to design intuitive interactive devises. The following two sessions are aimed at highlighting the importance of designing to minimise the amount of learning required. The following session uses activities similar to the style of those found in {CS website}.
For this, pupils are placed into two groups, the first group is given three lists: ingredients, portions and instructions. They must find a way to abstract away from the textual information and draw icons and symbols that will aid the second group of pupils put together a recipe. The list is small, "chocolate, milk, butter" and the portions are simple "a little", "a lot", "a big piece", "a medium piece", the instructions are also simple "start mixing", "stop mixing", "start pouring", etc. The students should enjoy themselves as they try to discover whether how close to the original recipe the second group's recipe is. After the session is complete the teacher should emphasise their learning of difficult but important it is to design interfaces with icons that are meaningful.
